### [Blog 1 - Offline caching with AWS Amplify, Tanstack, AppSync and MongoDB Atlas](3.1-Blog1/)

The article demonstrates how to build an offline-first application with optimistic UI using AWS Amplify, AWS AppSync, TanStack Query, and MongoDB Atlas. The sample to-do application showcases instant rendering of CRUD operation results on the UI before server requests complete, enhancing user experience. TanStack Query manages local caching to ensure data availability offline, while AWS Amplify and AppSync provide a full-stack framework and GraphQL API. MongoDB Atlas handles data storage, integrated with AWS Lambda and Cognito for serverless functionality and user management. The application is easily deployed via Amplify Gen 2, supporting data synchronization and a simple "first-come, first-served" conflict resolution mechanism, suitable for applications with minimal update conflicts.

### [Blog 2 - Introducing AWS CDK Community Meetings](3.2-Blog2/)

AWS announces a new community meeting series for the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK), providing opportunities for developers, from novices to experts, to learn, ask questions, and share feedback directly with the CDK team. Held twice quarterly, these virtual meetings cover roadmap updates, feature demos, RFC reviews, and open Q&A, with the first sessions scheduled for June 24, 2025, at 8–9 AM and 5–6 PM PDT to accommodate the global community. Details, agendas, and recordings will be shared on GitHub and YouTube. Community members can participate via Slack, propose topics on GitHub, and provide input through surveys to shape the CDK’s future.

### [Blog 3 - Secure your Express application APIs in 5 minutes with Cedar](3.3-Blog3/)

The article introduces the authorization-for-expressjs package from the open-source Cedar project, enabling Express applications on Node.js to integrate policy-based authorization in minutes, reducing code by 90% compared to manual integration. Using the PetStore sample app, Cedar decouples authorization logic, allowing fine-grained policy definitions, e.g., restricting write operations (POST /pets, POST /pets/{petId}/sale) to employees while allowing read operations (GET /pets, GET /pets/{petId}) for customers. The package auto-generates Cedar schemas from OpenAPI specs, creates sample policies, and integrates middleware for authorization without remote calls. Security is enhanced via JWT and OIDC, with policy validation easily tested using curl commands, improving developer productivity and simplifying access audits.
