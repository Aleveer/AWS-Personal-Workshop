# Introducing AWS CDK Community Meetings

We are excited to announce our new community meetings series for the [AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk) project. These meetings are designed to give everyone from seasoned contributors to new users a recurring opportunity to learn, ask questions, and share feedback directly with the AWS CDK team. We also see this as a great opportunity to engage with other members of the AWS CDK community.

## Why Community Meetings?

We originally considered forming a more formal governance model called the “Contributor Council”, but decided to pivot to a less formal, and more open and accessible format for a couple of reasons:

* **Broader Inclusivity**: We want to encourage participation from all interested developers, not just a small group.
* **Simpler Engagement**: A virtual meeting allows anyone in the community to attend, ask questions, and provide feedback without formalizing ownership or governance structures.

By hosting virtual community meetings, we can continue delivering the transparency and collaboration that the community values while retaining the flexibility to make decisions and drive the project forward with AWS as the maintainer of the project. We believe this is the best way to engage with our community in a meaningful way.

## How Frequently Can We Meet?

In order to ensure we make the best use of everyone’s time, we aim to meet twice every quarter. However this schedule can get impacted by ongoing events and holidays, so we will publish the date of the next meeting along with the agenda in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Acommunity-meeting%20) marked “[Community Meeting] – Date of meeting”.

## What to Expect

We are planning to cover a mix of the following topics based on interest and relevancy:

* **Roadmap Updates**: Get a sneak peek at upcoming features, enhancements, and project priorities.
* **Team Demos**: Our engineers will showcase new functionality or best practices in action.
* **RFC & Vision/Feature Reviews**: Provide direct input on proposed features or directions for the AWS CDK project.
* **Open Q&A**: A chance for you to ask questions directly to the AWS CDK team and fellow community members.
* **Future Topics & Sessions**: Additional events like community-led sessions or office hours may be introduced based on interest.

All sessions will be recorded and shared on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com), ensuring that anyone who can’t attend live can still catch up. We will also keep track of agendas and notes in GitHub [issues](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Acommunity-meeting%20) marked “[[Community Meeting] – 6/24/25](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/34716#event-18150102400)”, so you can easily follow along with meeting highlights. If you have any questions or topics that you’d like to see covered in the meeting, please add a comment to the issue for the upcoming meeting.

### First Session: June 24, 2025, 8am – 9am PDT / June 24, 2025, 5pm – 6pm PDT

These meetings provide a recurring forum for everyone in the community to have their voice heard in a direct and interactive way, beyond the traditional avenues like GitHub issues or pull requests.
